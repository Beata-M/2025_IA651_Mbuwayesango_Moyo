# Predicting Parkinson’s Disease Progression Using Machine Learning

## Project overview 
Parkinson’s Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement, speech, and various motor functions. Early and accurate tracking of its progression is critical for effective treatment and patient care. In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing voice measurements and clinical attributes from individuals with Parkinson’s Disease.

The primary objective is to build predictive models that estimate the progression of the disease using biomedical voice features and patient demographics. Through exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model development, we aim to identify patterns and markers that are indicative of disease advancement. This work not only showcases the power of machine learning in medical diagnostics but also contributes toward the development of non-invasive tools for disease monitoring.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is centered on analyzing the progression of Parkinson’s Disease based on various clinical, functional, and lifestyle-related features. It is sourced from Kaggle - Parkinson’s Disease Progression Dataset, which provides anonymized health records of 500 patients living with Parkinson’s Disease.

The dataset includes the following fields:

Patient_ID: Unique identifier for each patient

Age: Patient’s age

Gender: Biological sex of the patient (M/F)

Years_Since_Diagnosis: Time (in years) since Parkinson’s diagnosis

UPDRS_Score: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score

Tremor_Severity: Severity of tremors (scale: 0–5)

Motor_Function: Motor function impairment rating (scale: 0–5)

Speech_Difficulty: Degree of speech difficulty (scale: 0–5)

Balance_Problems: Level of balance issues experienced (scale: 0–5)

Medications: Primary medication prescribed (e.g., Levodopa, Amantadine, Ropinirole, Pramipexole)

Exercise_Level: Self-reported physical activity level (Low, Moderate, High)

Disease_Progression: Disease progression severity (target variable, scale: 1–3)

This dataset supports the development of machine learning models that can predict disease progression based on physical, behavioral, and treatment-related attributes. Such models can aid in early intervention, personalized care, and informed decision-making for both clinicians and patients.
