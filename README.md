# Predicting Parkinson’s Disease Progression Using Machine Learning

## About
This project explores the progression of Parkinson’s Disease using machine learning techniques. The dataset, consisting of 500 patient records, includes biomedical voice measurements and demographic features. Our goal is to analyze these features to predict the severity and progression of the disease over time. By applying regression and classification models, we aim to uncover patterns that may assist in early diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment planning. This project not only demonstrates the practical use of data science in healthcare but also contributes to the growing field of AI-driven medical research.
